In July, house prices varied widely, hitting a peak of $766,667 on July 06 and dropping to a low of $286,308 on July 27. This shows considerable ups and downs in prices throughout the month. 


**2. House price distribution:**

The majority of house values fall within the range of 200k to 800k. There are only a few houses priced over 1000k, indicating that most properties are in the midrange and not considered luxurious.


**3. Heatmap:**

Most houses with a decent outer view tend to have conditions ranging from average to very good. However, for houses without a decent view, many exhibit a very poor condition. This suggests a correlation between a good outer appearance and the overall condition of the house.

**4. Room Distribution:**

Most houses have between 2 to 5 bedrooms and more than 1 bathroom. This trend suggests they're suitable for medium to large families, providing enough space and necessary amenities.

**5. Filters**

The dashboard offers various filters to refine results based on specific needs. It includes a calendar for selecting dates and allows sorting houses by their built year, living space (in square feet), and total space (in square feet).
