The majority of house values fall within the range of 200k to 800k. There are only a few houses priced over 1000k, indicating that most properties are in the midrange and not considered luxurious.


**3. Heatmap:**

Most houses with a decent outer view tend to have conditions ranging from average to very good. However, for houses without a decent view, many exhibit a very poor condition. This suggests a correlation between a good outer appearance and the overall condition of the house.
